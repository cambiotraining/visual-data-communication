## Purpose and aim

Depending on the message we want to get across with our visualisation, we might want to order or rank our data.

## Loading data

If you haven't done so yet, please load the data as follows:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
#| message: false
gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder_clean.csv")
```

:::

Using the `gapminder` data set, let's look at the following example.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
#| echo: false
p1 <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(world_region) %>% 
  summarise(mean_income = mean(income_per_person)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = world_region, y = mean_income)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = "World region", y = "Mean income")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
p2 <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(world_region) %>% 
  summarise(mean_income = mean(income_per_person)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(world_region, mean_income),
             y = mean_income)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = "World region", y = "Mean income")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
p1 + p2 + plot_annotation(title = "Same data, different purpose",
                          tag_levels = "A")
```

:::

So what happened here? Both plots show the average income across the countries within each world region. In panel A the different regions are ordered alphabetically, whereas in panel B they are displayed in ascending order of average income.

Same data, but a different purpose! When would we use one or the other?

If we simply wanted a look-up table, where we could easily find the average income for a specific world region, then we would want to use the representation in panel A. Let's say we want to find the value for South Asia - we'd follow along the x-axis in alphabetical order. Doing the same in panel B is actually much harder.

If we're interested in the world regions with particularly high average levels of income, then panel B would be more suitable. We'd simply look at the world regions that are displayed towards the right of the plot.

## Reordering data

The process of reordering your data, depending on the purpose of your visualisation, can be a bit tricky.

To understand this a bit better it's important to get our head round some different categorical data types, wonderfully illustrated by [Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst):

![](images/data-types.png)

The type we are focusing on is the **ordinal** data. These are descriptions (so not numerical data) that have some kind of order.

This can be an inherent order, for example a range of emotions from good to bad. Using the illustration we'd expect the bee to feel `awesome`, `ok` and `unhappy` in that order.

It can also be an order that we are imposing ourselves. Again, using the illustration we can talk about `turtle`, `snail` and `butterfly`. These have no inherent order, but maybe we want to impose one, such as alphabetical order. If we'd do that, they would be arranged as `butterfly`, `snail`, `turtle`.

The way that programming languages deal with this kind of ordering is through **factors**. These are categorical data that have a fixed and known set of values.

Let's illustrate this with the bee example. Assume we followed a certain bee for 5 hours and recorded it emotional state once per hour. We could, hypothetically of course, end up with the following observations:

`ok`, `awesome`, `unhappy`, `ok`, `unhappy`

The bee was clearly not having the best of days. But I digress.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

If we wanted to code these states in R, then we would do the following:

```{r}
bee <- c("ok", "awesome", "unhappy", "ok", "unhappy")

bee
```

They appear in the order that I observed them. Now let's say that I want to impose a certain order on them, maybe alphabetically. I could take my `bee` object and convert it to a factor.

```{r}
bee_factor <- factor(bee)

bee_factor
```

The first line still gives me the 5 observations in their original order, but below it there are `Levels: awesome ok unhappy`.

What's happened here is that R recognises that there are three distinct possible values in our data, `awesome`, `ok` and `unhappy`. And it's ordered them alphabetically, which is the default.

If I'd want to change this order, I can specify the levels directly:

```{r}
factor(bee_factor, levels = c("unhappy", "ok", "awesome"))
```
:::

Now let's see how we translate this to our data set. Let's create box plots for `income_per_person` for each main religion. We'll look at the default order, and then change it.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

Income per person for each religion:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder,
       aes(x = main_religion, y = income_per_person)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

This is in alphabetical order, by default.

Let's say we wanted to change it. One of the ways we could do this is by making the `main_religion` column a factor and changing its order. Let's say we wanted to arrange them in order of average income. We could find this out by calculating the average income for each religion:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(main_religion) %>% 
  summarise(mean_income = mean(income_per_person)) %>% 
  arrange(mean_income) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

We would then order the data as follows:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(main_religion = factor(main_religion,
                                levels = c("eastern religions", "muslim", "christian"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = main_religion, y = income_per_person)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

This works, but you can imagine that if you have lots of groups then doing this by manually specifying the levels becomes very (very!) tedious.

Thankfully there is another way of doing exactly the same, without manual specifying the order. This uses the `fct_reorder()` function to... reorder the factor (what's in the name?!).

The way that it works is that you give it the data you want to reorder, then tell it what to reorder by. In our case we want to reorder by the mean income for each religion, so we need to calculate that first.  After that we reorder the data directly within `ggplot()`:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  # group by main religion
  group_by(main_religion) %>% 
  # create a new column that contains the average
  # income for that type of religion
  mutate(mean_income = mean(income_per_person)) %>% 
  # remove the grouping
  ungroup() %>% 
  # send the data to ggplot
  # and fct_reorder the main_religion on the x-axis
  # based on the calculated mean_income
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(main_religion, mean_income),
             y = income_per_person)) +
  # create box plots
  geom_boxplot()
```

:::

## Stem plots

The bar plot was useful when there weren't too many observations. However, if we have lots of observations, then it can become a bit crowded. Have a look at the plot below, where we're looking at the income per person for all the countries in the Middle East / North Africa region:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(world_region == "middle_east_north_africa") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = country, y = income_per_person)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
```

:::

Another way that we could display those data is by creating a stem plot (or lollipop plot).

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(world_region == "middle_east_north_africa") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = country, y = income_per_person)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = country, yend = 0)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
```

:::

This type of plot can be useful if you have lots of categories, since each category takes up a bit less space than a bar.

### Exercises

## Reordering data FIXME

**Level:** {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa regular star >}}

Below is a chunk of code. In several places the code states `<FIXME>`. Try to make the necessary changes, so that you end up with a stem plot that displays the number of children per woman, for each country in Europe and Central Asia. 
Reorder the data by number of children per woman, from high to low.

Which country has the **second highest** number of children per woman?

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
#| eval: false
gapminder %>% 
  filter(world_region == <FIXME>) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(country,
                             <FIXME>(children_per_woman)),
             y = children_per_woman)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = <FIXME>, yend = 0)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = "Country",
       y = "Children per woman")
```

## Answer

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(world_region == "europe_central_asia") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(country,
                             desc(children_per_woman)),
             y = children_per_woman)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = country, yend = 0)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = "Country",
       y = "Children per woman")
```

:::

The country with the second highest number of children per woman is the Kyrgyz Republic (Kyrgyzstan).
